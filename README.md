Build your own IPTV app, using this template and Pastebin for channel sources.

To make your own playlist it's very easy, just edit the URL in AppDelegate.swift file within Xcode to your "raw" link Pastebin playlist. Then side-load the app to your new Apple TV. So when you want to change or add channels you just need to make all the changes on your Pastebin file using your computer and Voilà! Pretty easy eh ? :-)

PS: Please expect some delay for Pastebin to process your file, sometime the "raw" is updated by Pastebin every 30-60 minutes after you've made the changes.

Also the format of your Pastebin file needs to be very specific, look at the exemple playlist to help you build your own. It's not that hard.

Enjoy!

3) An Apple TV 4th generation (the new one)

4) A USB-C cable to sideload your app on your Apple TV
